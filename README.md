### Hi, I'm KHRISS ABDELAADIM ðŸ‘‹

I pride myself in being a Software developer . I chose that field of study because Iâ€™ve always been interested in Programming and computer science .
I'm always looking to be challenged , and to challenge others.Driving skilled designers to think outside the box , and really bring out their artistic abilities is what motivates me , Let's connect and see what we can do together !
My areas of expertise include :
Web development Full stack (.NET ) , Desktop Application(.NET ) , Android Development(Java,Kotlin) and Time management 


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning business intelligence (BI) and Android Developement
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about android developement , c# or any tech related stuff
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goals: Contribute more to Open Source projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love study Motivational Speaking / Public Speaking
